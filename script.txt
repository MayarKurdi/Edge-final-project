<cite><blockquote><font color="darkred"> Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold, while more lethal varieties can cause COVID-19. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. </font></blockquote></cite>

<font color="green"><h3> Facts about COVID-19 </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Most people who get COVID-19 recover from it </li>
  <li> The likelihood of shoes spreading COVID-19 is very low </li>
  <li> The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, NOT by bacteria </li>
  <li>  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. </li>
   <li> Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals with some of them also known to infect humans. <br> Bats are considered natural hosts of these viruses yet several other species of animals are also known to act as sources. For instance, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is transmitted to humans from camels, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) is transmitted to humans from civet cats. More information on coronaviruses can be found in the disease background of COVID-19.</li>

<h4> <p align="right"><font color="grey">   Where did the virus originate?
Chinese health authorities are still trying to determine the origin of the virus, which they say likely came from a seafood market in Wuhan, China where wildlife was traded illegally.<br>
On February 7, Chinese researchers said the virus could have spread from an infected animal species to humans through illegally-trafficked pangolins.Scientists have pointed to either bats or snakes as possible sources of the virus.

<h4> <p align="left"><font color="darkgreen"> Symptoms of COVID-19 vary in severity from having no symptoms at all (being asymptomatic) to having fever, cough, sore throat, general weakness and fatigue and muscular pain and in the most severe cases, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock, all potentially leading to death. Reports show that clinical deterioration can occur rapidly, often during the second week of disease. <br>
Recently, anosmia – loss of the sense of smell – (and in some cases the loss of the sense of taste) have been reported as a symptom of a COVID-19 infection. There is already evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia, in some cases in the absence of any other symptoms.
</font></p></h4>


<h2> <p align="center"><font color="purple"> According to the WHO, signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Other signs include loss of taste or smell as well as muscle aches.In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and even death.<br>
Current estimates of the incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days. Most infected people show symptoms within five to six days.
However, infected patients can also be asymptomatic, meaning they do not display any symptoms despite having the virus in their systems.
