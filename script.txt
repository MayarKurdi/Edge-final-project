<cite><blockquote><font color="darkred"> Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold, while more lethal varieties can cause COVID-19. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. </font></blockquote></cite>

<h4> <p align="right"><font color="grey">   Where did the virus originate?
Chinese health authorities are still trying to determine the origin of the virus, which they say likely came from a seafood market in Wuhan, China where wildlife was traded illegally.<br>
On February 7, Chinese researchers said the virus could have spread from an infected animal species to humans through illegally-trafficked pangolins.Scientists have pointed to either bats or snakes as possible sources of the virus.

<h2> <p align="center"><font color="purple"> According to the WHO, signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Other signs include loss of taste or smell as well as muscle aches.In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and even death.<br>
Current estimates of the incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days. Most infected people show symptoms within five to six days.
However, infected patients can also be asymptomatic, meaning they do not display any symptoms despite having the virus in their systems.
